Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
Hello ME :)

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does

the ' git fetch' command pulls all the information from the master file to the local files,
essentially updating them.

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
"GitHub" is the master repository. "Git" is basically the local repository. Changes
in "GitHub" do not necessarily show up in "Git" right away without using the
'git fetch' command.
